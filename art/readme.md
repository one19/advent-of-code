# Art:

While plotting the matrix for day six, trying to diagnose a bug in the code, I generated the following plot in [./6-matrix.txt](./6-matrix.txt).

I wanted to stash the borked version here because it's too interesting to just dump forever.

Realized I made a logical mistake in  [./matrix2.txt](./matrix2.txt).

And the final really lovely looking matrix plot: [./final-matrix.txt](./final-matrix.txt).
